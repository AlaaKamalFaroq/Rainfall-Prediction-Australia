# 🌦️ Predicting Rainfall in Australia

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes **10 years of Australian weather data** from Kaggle, with the goal of **predicting rainfall patterns** and providing actionable insights.  

The dataset contains daily weather observations such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall across multiple Australian cities.  
By applying **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques**, we uncover seasonal trends and identify the top rainiest locations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze rainfall patterns across **seasons and cities**.  
- Identify the **top 5 rainiest cities** per season.  
- Build clear **visualizations** (bar plots, heatmaps) to communicate insights.  
- Lay the groundwork for predictive modeling (rain tomorrow).  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data cleaning & processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualizations  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Summer** shows the highest average rainfall.  
-  **Spring** tends to be the driest season.  
- Some cities consistently record high rainfall across all seasons.  
- Seasonal heatmaps help identify **regional rainfall patterns** at a glance.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **data analysis and visualization** can uncover valuable insights from real-world weather data.  
It can be extended with **machine learning models** to predict **“Will it rain tomorrow?”**, making it useful for **agriculture, planning, and climate research**.
